In this project, I explored the security of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are commonly used for authentication in APIs. I looked into how JWTs ensure security and what can go wrong if they are not configured properly. The project focused on aspects such as proper setup and use of JWTs, as well as common mistakes that could lead to vulnerabilities in the system.

During the project, I learned how to:

Properly use tokens for authentication — for instance, I figured out how to correctly make requests to obtain a JWT and how to use them to access protected resources. Understand the structure of JWTs — I studied how they are built, what the header, payload, and signature consist of, and what algorithms are used to sign them. Develop security-related JWT skills — it’s crucial that the data within tokens is protected from attacks, such as password leaks or flags in the payload. Handle signature verification errors — I also learned how failing to verify the signature or using weak secrets could lead to system compromise. Properly manage token expiration times — I saw how important it is to set token lifetimes to prevent their use after expiration. The project showed me how important it is to maintain security when working with tokens to avoid common vulnerabilities such as data leaks, improper signature verification, or uncontrolled JWT use across different services.
